# Jmeter wrapper

## Vision

This is not meant for single-user, command-line usage. It's meant to be used in scripts - to provide a more easily programmable, user-friendly, readable API to jmeter. In Ruby.


## Product

This must be able to launch Jmeter, whether a single instance or many slaves, and dynamically support the possible -D and -G options which can change the behavior of the jmeter profile if set by the user. System-level constraints, like SSH keys, are probably implementation details

### Versions, features

Examine github. Bug @Trevoke.

Example of usage (object names are not marked in stone):

```ruby
jmeter = Jmeter::Wrapper.new :plan => 'TestPlan.jmx', :threads => 1000, :duration => 300, :remote_servers => ['remote1', 'remote2']
jmeter.start # => possibly replaces the current process with the jmeter process - or daemonizes it. This process does not need to exist anymore.
```


### Constraints

The following options are passed as command-line options and must be stored as User-defined variables in jmeter, like such:
```
${__P(duration,1800)}
```
* duration (in seconds)
* target_host
* rampup
* delay
