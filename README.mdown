= Jmeter wrapper

Starting Jmeter is really annoying. And I am really lazy. I heard this somewhere.. Why spend five minutes doing something you can spend ten years automating? Granted, the next best thing is getting paid for ten years automating it.

So the goal is to allow this to start an instance of Jmeter through a really simple configuration. No, really. Stop laughing, that's quite rude of you.
